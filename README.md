# Responsive Portfolio

## Description

I was tasked with creating a homepage for myself, containing three pages (home/index,portfolio,and contact) as well as certain pre-determined elements (a navbar and responsive layout/images,)
using the Bootstrap CSS framewpork. 

I began by finding resources to consult, mainly on Bootstrap's own website. With their guidance I began creating a navbar, which I applied to all three pages as a framework
to build on. I then constructed the landing page, or About Me (index.html,) practicing working with Bootstrap's Grid layout and provided CSS classes to build a responsive
page that could be easily read on a variety of devices. I then applied what I had learned, along with code provided by Bootstrap, to create the second two pages. Finally,
I customized the pages to better reflect myself and my aesthetic as best I could. 

My experience with coding so far has been confined to code I understand enough to build myself--diving into Bootstrap's franework was a lesson in reading as well as applying code.
While I do not feel my page is perfect, I am very satisfied with it's responsiveness. I also believe it represents a solid foundation, both as a homepage and for the continued 
evolution of my skillset.

## 'Installation'/Usage

The site can be accessed at [https://mavn2.github.io/Portfolio/](https://mavn2.github.io/Portfolio/). 
The code is stored in the Portfolio repository on my Github page, [https://github.com/mavn2](https://github.com/mavn2).
My working codebase with commit history is located in the classrep repository on that same page, in the file 2HW.

## Tests

The site's links can be tested, of course, by clicking on them, and its responsiveness can be tested by re-sizing your browser window.

It can be tested further by opening the developer tools in Google Chrome or (likely) any Chromium based browser by using the developer tools, 
which can be accessed either by dropdown menu or keyboard shortcut. Click the 'Toggle device toolbar" button to test how the page would appear
on a variety of mobile phones and tablets.
